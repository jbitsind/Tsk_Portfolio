Perception and data-quality practitioner with experience supporting computer vision pipelines through dataset preparation, consistency
checks, and evaluation. Detail-oriented, process-driven, and comfortable working with SOPs, edge cases, and fast feedback loops with
engineers and researchers.

EXPERIENCE

Carnegie Mellon University Africa

• Research Associate – Systems & Data Engineering

Kigali, Rwanda

Jul 2025 – Dec 2025

⋆ Built reliable multi-node sensor data pipelines by collecting, synchronizing, and validating telemetry; identified packet loss,

timestamp drift, and corrupted records.

⋆ Improved dataset usability by cleaning, normalizing, and enforcing schema/unit/metadata consistency across heterogeneous

sensor sources.

• Graduate Research Assistant – AI/ML Engineer

Sep 2024 – Dec 2024

⋆ Standardized data collection and dataset curation for a 3D reconstruction workflow, enabling repeatable experiments and

clearer annotation/QA conventions.

⋆ Supported peer-reviewed publications (IDETC-CIE ASME 2024 Best Paper; ASME Journal of Mechanical Design) via ver-

sioned datasets, experiment logs, and evaluation criteria.

⋆ Reduced prototype design cycle time by 40% by integrating automated workflow steps and documenting handoffs for team

reuse.

• Taxi Fare Prediction Application (Cloud Computing Capstone)

Oct 2024 – Dec 2024

⋆ Implemented reproducible preprocessing and validation checks to convert noisy inputs into model-ready features; deployed a

low-latency API (< 200 ms) on App Engine.

• Smart Sorter: Real-Time Waste Classification on Edge (DL Capstone)

Feb 2024 – Apr 2024

⋆ Achieved 94% accuracy by curating a balanced dataset, generating synthetic images (Stable Diffusion), and applying consistent

labeling rules.

⋆ Performed k-fold cross-validation and error analysis to identify ambiguous samples and common failure modes; optimized

deployment with TensorRT.

• Unified Data Aggregation & Visualization Pipeline (DB Capstone)

Sep 2024 – Dec 2024

⋆ Resolved schema mismatches across PostgreSQL/MongoDB; automated ETL (Prefect) and built Dash/Plotly monitoring for

data quality and traceability.

ICTP-East African Institute for Fundamental Research (ICTP-EAIFR)

• Graduate Researcher – Machine Learning

Kigali, Rwanda

Jan 2023 – Jul 2023

⋆ Improved molecular prediction accuracy by 30% by fitting Potential Energy Surfaces (ANN, KNN, Gaussian Processes) and

validating in quantum-dynamics simulations.
