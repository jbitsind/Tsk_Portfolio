EXPERIENCE

UPANZI NETWORK, Kigali, Rwanda
Research Associate — Data Analysis & Systems Engineering

July 2025 — Dec 2025

• Led the end-to-end analysis and structuring of large-scale GIS datasets for Kigali’s water distribution network, trans-

forming raw utility data into analysis-ready digital-twin assets.

• Designed and validated network topology, DMA segmentation, and asset registries, enabling leakage analysis, system

monitoring, and pilot deployment planning.

• Developed interactive geospatial dashboards and web-based visualizations to support data-driven decision-making for

engineers and field operators.

• Standardized data schemas, quality checks, and export pipelines (QGIS, GeoJSON, CSV) to ensure reproducibility

across hydraulic modeling, analytics, and visualization workflows.

• Presented analytical findings and system demos to WASAC leadership, incorporating operational feedback into phased

deployment and data-collection strategies.

CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY AFRICA, Kigali, Rwanda
Graduate Research Assistant

Sep 2024 — Dec 2024

• Led a multidisciplinary student team to develop an AI-driven pipeline for 3D prosthetic socket design using smartphone

video input and FDM 3D printing, improving accessibility for low-resource settings.

• Managed end-to-end model optimization, data preprocessing, experiment design, and pipeline evaluation.
• Co-authored a journal paper in the Journal of Mechanical Design extended from IDETC-CIE ASME 2024.
• Refined reconstruction algorithms to boost accuracy and usability for clinical applications.

CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY AFRICA, Kigali, Rwanda
